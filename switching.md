### 1.1 Standards.........................................................................................................................................

```
From time to time, Mastercard Switching Services sets Standards governing Network Activity.
Mastercard Switching Services has the sole right to interpret and enforce the Standards.
```
```
Mastercard Switching Services has the right, but not the obligation, to resolve any dispute
between or among Network Participants including, but not limited to, any dispute involving
Mastercard Switching Services, the Standards, or the Network Participants’ respective Network
Activities, and any such resolution by Mastercard Switching Services is final and not subject to
appeal, review, or other challenge. In resolving disputes between or among Network
Participants, or in applying the Standards to Network Participants, Mastercard Switching
Services may deviate from any process in the Standards or that Mastercard Switching Services
otherwise applies, and may implement an alternative process, if an event, including, without
limitation, an account data compromise event, is, in the sole judgment of Mastercard Switching
Services, of sufficient scope, complexity and/or magnitude to warrant such deviation.
```
```
Mastercard Switching Services will exercise its discretion to deviate from its Standards only in
circumstances that Mastercard Switching Services determines to be extraordinary. Any decision
to alter or suspend the application of any process (es) will not be subject to appeal, review, or
other challenge.
```
### 1.1.1 Variances.................................................................................................................................................

#### 1.1.1 Variances.................................................................................................................................

```
A variance is the consent by Mastercard Switching Services for a Network Participant to act
other than in accordance with a Standard. Only a Network Participant may request a variance.
Any such request must specify the Rules or other Standards for which a variance is sought. The
request must be submitted to Mastercard Switching Services in writing, together with a
statement of the reason for the request.
```
### 1.1.2 Failure to Comply with a Standard....................................................................................................

#### 1.1.2 Failure to Comply with a Standard.....................................................................................

```
Failure to comply with any Standard adversely affects Mastercard Switching Services and its
Network Participants and undermines the integrity of the Network. Accordingly, a Network
Participant that fails to comply with any Standard is subject to assessments (“noncompliance
assessments”) as set forth in the Standards.
```
```
In lieu of, or in addition to, the imposition of a noncompliance assessment, Mastercard Switching
Services, in its sole discretion, may require a Network Participant to take such action and
Mastercard Switching Services itself may take such action as Mastercard Switching Services
deems necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with the Standards and safeguard the
integrity of the Mastercard system. In the exercise of such discretion, Mastercard Switching
Services may consider the nature, willfulness, number and frequency of occurrences and possible
consequences resulting from a failure to comply with any Standard. Mastercard Switching
Services may provide notice and limited time to cure such noncompliance before imposing a
noncompliance assessment.
```
```
Standards and Conduct of Network Activity
1.1 Standards
```
© 2016–2024 Mastercard. Proprietary. All rights reserved.


```
Mastercard Switching Services reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate a Network
Participant’s access to the Network, if that Network Participant does not comply with any
Standards or with any decision of Mastercard Switching Services with regard to the
interpretation and enforcement of any Standards.
```
### 1.1.3 Noncompliance Categories..................................................................................................................

#### 1.1.3 Noncompliance Categories...................................................................................................

```
From time to time, Mastercard Switching Services may establish programs that address
instances of noncompliance with particular Standards. Every instance of noncompliance with a
Standard not addressed by such a program falls into at least one of the following three
compliance categories.
```
```
Category A: Payment System Integrity
```
```
Category A noncompliance affects payment system integrity. Mastercard Switching Services
has the authority to impose monetary noncompliance assessments for Category A
noncompliance. “Payment system integrity” violations include, but are not limited to, failure to
protect Card, Account, and Transaction information.
```
```
Category B: Visible to Customers
```
```
Category B noncompliance addresses conduct that is visible to customers of the Network
Participants. Mastercard Switching Services has the authority to impose monetary
noncompliance assessments for Category B noncompliance or, in the alternative, may provide
notice and a limited time to cure such noncompliance before imposing monetary assessments.
“Visible to Customers” violations include, but are not limited to, noncompliance involving the
identification of Transactions and identification of the Merchant at the POI.
```
```
Category C: Efficiency and Operational Performance
```
```
Category C noncompliance addresses efficiency and operational performance. Mastercard
Switching Services has the authority to impose monetary noncompliance assessments for
Category C noncompliance or, in the alternative, may provide notice and a limited time to cure
such noncompliance before imposing monetary assessments. “Efficiency and operational
performance” violations include, but are not limited to, noncompliance involving presentment of
Transactions within the required time frame, reporting procedures, and the obligation to provide
Mastercard Switching Services with requested information.
```
### 1.1.4 Noncompliance Assessments..............................................................................................................

#### 1.1.4 Noncompliance Assessments...............................................................................................

```
The following schedule pertains to any Standard that does not have an established compliance
program. Mastercard Switching Services may deviate from this schedule at any time.
```
```
In the following table, all days refer to calendar days and violations of a Standard are tracked on
a rolling 12-month basis.

### 1.2 Suspension and Termination of Access to Network..................................................................

suspended.
```
### 1.2.1 Voluntary Termination..........................................................................................................................

#### 1.2.1 Voluntary Termination...........................................................................................................

```
A Network Participant may voluntarily terminate its use of the Network by providing 180 days

effectively cease to use the Network for authorization, clearing and settlement.
```
### 1.2.2 Suspension or Termination by Mastercard Switching Services.....................................................

#### 1.2.2 Suspension or Termination by Mastercard Switching Services......................................

```
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any agreement with a Network
Participant, Mastercard Switching Services, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate a
Network Participant’s access to the Network effective immediately and without prior notice, if:
```
1. The Network Participant takes the required action by vote of its directors, stockholders,
    members, or other persons with the legal power to do so, or otherwise acts, to cease
    operations and to wind up the business of the Network Participant, such termination to be
    effective upon the date of the vote or other action; or
2. The Network Participant fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of
    business or becomes insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seeks
    the protection, by the filing of a petition or otherwise, of any bankruptcy or similar statute
    governing creditors’ rights generally; or
3. The government or the governmental regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the
    Network Participant serves a notice of intention to suspend or revoke, or suspends or
    revokes, the operations or the charter of the Network Participant; or

4. A liquidating agent, conservator, or receiver is appointed for the Network Participant, or the
    Network Participant is placed in liquidation by any appropriate governmental, regulatory, or
    judicial authority; or
5. The Network Participant (i) directly or indirectly engages in or facilitates any action or
    activity that is illegal, or that, in the good faith opinion of Mastercard Switching Services,
    and whether or not addressed elsewhere in the Standards, has damaged or threatens to
    damage the goodwill or reputation of Mastercard Switching Services or of any of its Marks;
    or (ii) makes or continues an association with a person or entity which association, in the
    good faith opinion of Mastercard Switching Services, has damaged or threatens to damage
    the goodwill or reputation of Mastercard Switching Services or of any of its Marks; or
6. The Network Participant fails to timely provide to Mastercard Switching Services
    information requested by Mastercard Switching Services and that the Network Participant
    is required to provide pursuant to the Standards.
7. The Network Participant fails to engage in Network Activity for 26 consecutive weeks or
    materially fails to operate at a scale or volume of operations consistent with the level
    agreed with Mastercard Switching Services.
8. Mastercard Switching Services has reason to believe that the Network Participant is, or is a
    front for, or is assisting in the concealment of, a person or entity that engages in, attempts
    or threatens to engage in, or facilitates terrorist activity, narcotics trafficking, trafficking in
    persons, activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, activity that
    violates or threatens to violate human rights or principles of national sovereignty, or money
    laundering to conceal any such activity. In this regard, and although not dispositive,
    Mastercard Switching Services may consider the appearance of the Network Participant, its
    owner or a related person or entity on a United Nations or domestic or foreign governmental
    sanction list that identifies persons or entities believed to engage in such illicit activity; or
9. Mastercard Switching Services has reason to believe that not terminating access to the
    Network would be harmful to its or the Corporation’s goodwill or reputation.

### 1.2.3 Rights, Liabilities, and Obligations of a Network Participant Following Termination...............

```
All of the following apply with respect to a Network Participant following termination of access
to the Network:
```
```
A Network Participant is not entitled to any refund of dues, fees, assessments, or other
payments and remains liable for, and must promptly pay (a) any and all applicable dues, fees,
assessments, or other charges as provided in the Standards and (b) all other charges, debts,
liabilities, and other amounts arising or owed in connection with the Network Participant’s
Network Activity, whether arising, due, accrued, or owing before or after termination.
```
```

2.4.5 Data Subject Rights
```
© 2016–2024 Mastercard. Proprietary. All rights reserved.


```
To the extent that Mastercard Switching Services makes any transfer of Personal Data subject
to EU Data Protection Law to a Network Participant in a Third Country, the Parties agree that
the transfer shall be governed by the EU SCCs, which are hereby incorporated by reference, as
though such obligations were set out in full in these Standards, and with the Network
Participant's and the Mastercard Switching Services' signature and dating of the relevant
Agreement, or other enrollment form, announcement, or any other relevant documents by which
Network Participant is bound by these Standards being deemed to be the signature and dating
of the EU SCCs. The EU SCCs are completed as follows:
```
- The Parties conclude Module Four (processor-to-controller) of the EU SCCs;
- The "data exporter" is Mastercard Switching Services; the "data importer" is Network
    Participant;
- Clause 16 (Governing law): the clauses shall be governed by the laws of Belgium;
- The information as required by Annex I of the SCCs is as set out in Annex A.

```
The Parties conclude the UK Addendum for transfers of Personal Data subject to the UK Data
Protection Act from Corporation to Customer in a country that is not subject to a UK adequacy
decision. The UK Addendum is hereby incorporated by reference.
```
```
If the Corporation's compliance with EU Data Protection Law applicable to international data
transfers is affected by circumstances outside of the Corporation's control, including if a legal
instrument for international data transfers is invalidated, amended, or replaced, then Customer
and the Corporation will work together in good faith to reasonably resolve such noncompliance.
```
```
In the event the Corporation is compelled to comply with a Disclosure Request and such
disclosure causes Customer to breach EU Data Protection Law, Customer represents and
warrants that it will not hold the Corporation liable for such disclosure. Customer further agrees
that, to the greatest extent authorized by applicable law, it will not revoke or amend its
instruction to Process Personal Data unless strictly required by EU Data Protection Law. Any
amendments to Customer's instructions to Process Personal Data, such as where necessary to
ensure the continued compliance with EU Data Protection Law, must be agreed by both parties
in writing prior to taking effect.
```

audit. Mastercard Switching Services will make available to the Network Participants the result
of the audit of its data protection compliance program.
```
#### 2.4.11 Personal Data Breaches.....................................................................................................

```
Where Mastercard Switching Services acts as a Processor, it will inform Network Participants
without undue delay, and no later than 48 hours after having become aware of it, of a Personal
Data Breach. Mastercard Switching Services will assist Network Participants in complying with
their own obligations to notify a Personal Data Breach. Mastercard Switching Services and
Network Participants must document all Personal Data Breaches, including the facts relating to
the Personal Data Breach, its effects, and the remedial action taken.
```
#### 2.4.12 Termination and Mandatory Retention...........................................................................

```
To the extent that Mastercard Switching Services acts as a Processor, upon Termination of the
provision of Mastercard Switching Services or upon requests to delete or return Personal Data,
Mastercard Switching Services will, at the choice of the relevant Network Participant, delete,
anonymize, or return all the Personal Data to such Network Participant, and delete or
anonymize existing copies unless applicable law prevents it from returning or destroying all or
part of the Personal Data or requires storage of the Personal Data in which case Mastercard
Switching Services will protect the confidentiality of the Personal Data and will not actively

damage caused by the Processing only where it has not complied with obligations of EU Data
Protection Law specifically directed to Processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to
Network Participant’s lawful instructions. Mastercard Switching Services will be exempt from
liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Where one or more Network Participants and/or Mastercard Switching Services are involved in
the same Processing and where they are responsible for any damage caused by the Processing,
each may be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the
Data Subject. If Mastercard Switching Services paid full compensation for the damage
suffered, it is entitled to claim back from the Network Participants involved in the same
Processing that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the
damage.

Settlement and Related Obligations
```
© 2016–2024 Mastercard. Proprietary. All rights reserved.


### 3.1 Net Settlement...............................................................................................................................

```
A Network Participant that uses the Network for clearing of Transactions is required to net
settle in accordance with the settlement Standards. However, an Acquirer and an Issuer may,
with respect to a particular Transaction, agree to settle directly between themselves pursuant
to a bilateral agreement.
Standards describing net settlement and bilateral agreement rights and obligations are set
forth in the Settlement Manual.
```
#### 3.1.1 Currency Conversion..............................................................................................................

```
Mastercard Switching Services converts Transactions processed through use of the Network
into the applicable settlement currency. The Acquirer must submit each Transaction in the
currency in which it occurred.
If two Network Participants elect not to settle a Transaction by using the Network and instead
elect to settle directly between themselves in accordance with a bilateral agreement, any
Transaction currency that Mastercard Switching Services supports is acceptable for settlement.
```
#### 3.1.2 Settlement Finality................................................................................................................

```
Mastercard Switching Services determines the net obligations of the Network Participants
under the Standards. Network Participants’ net obligations are calculated by Mastercard
Switching Services’ proprietary small value clearing systems and are based upon accepted
financial messages submitted by the Network Participants to the Network.
Financial messages are considered irrevocable, by Network Participants, upon completion of the
clearing system cutoff. However, in accordance with the Standards, Network Participants may
submit a separate financial message to offset a previously submitted financial message.
```
```
Mastercard Switching Services subsequently creates instructions, reflecting the Network
Participants’ end-of-day net obligations, which result in the assumption or discharge of
payment obligations between Network Participants. These instructions are effected by Network
Participants and the settlement agents of Mastercard Switching Services. Settlement finality
of the transfer order is determined by the rules of the national payment system in which the
funds transfer is executed.
```
##### 3.1.2.1 Cooperation with Government Authorities..............................................................

```
Each Network Participant agrees and acknowledges that, for the purposes of administering the
Network, Mastercard Switching Services may from time to time co-operate (by sharing of
information or otherwise) with:

2. The National Bank of Belgium (“NBB”);
3. Bank of England (“BoE”); and

On an ongoing basis, an Acquirer of Mastercard POS Transactions must recognize all active
Mastercard bank identification numbers (BINs) for purposes of obtaining Transaction
authorizations, and obtain such authorizations on behalf of each of its Merchants as the
Standards require.
```
```
If the Acquirer uses Account range files provided by Mastercard Switching Services for this
purpose, such files must be loaded and functioning on the Acquirer’s host system and available
to its Merchants for use within six calendar days from the date that each updated file is
distributed. Upon receipt of an updated Account range file from Mastercard Switching Services,
an Acquirer must confirm via an acknowledgment file that it updated its host systems
accordingly. Alternatively, the Acquirer may submit all authorization requests containing an
Account number with a BIN in either the 222100 to 272099 range or the 510000 to 559999
range to the Network for routing to the Issuer.

### 5.3 Authorization Routing—Maestro POS, ATM Terminal, and PIN-based..................................

```
An Acquirer of Maestro POS Transactions, ATM Transactions, and/or Manual Cash
Disbursement Transactions occurring at PIN-based In-Branch Terminals may default route to
the Network any such Transaction not belonging to its proprietary network. The Network
determines whether or not the Transaction is being performed by a Cardholder.
```
```
The Acquirer must ensure that the files are loaded and functioning on its host systems and
available to its Merchants, ATM Terminals, and PIN-based In-Branch Terminals for use within six
calendar days from the date that each updated file is distributed. Upon receipt of an updated
file, the Acquirer must confirm to Mastercard Switching Services via an acknowledgment file
that it has updated its host systems accordingly.
```
### 5.4 Authorization and Clearing Requirements.................................................................................

```
This topic describes the authorization and clearing requirements.
```
#### 5.4.1 Authorization Requirements................................................................................................

```
In the event that an Issuer chooses not to offer a particular Transaction message type to its
Cardholders, the Issuer must provide a value of 57 indicating "transaction not permitted to
issuer/cardholder" in DE 39 (Response Code) of the online authorization message.
```
##### 5.4.1.1 Acquirer Authorization Requirements........................................................................

```
Echoing of Transaction Link ID
```
```
Effective 17 October 2025, an Acquirer must populate DE 105 (Multi-Use Transaction
Identification Data), subelement 001 (Transaction Link Identifier [TLID]) of each incremental
Authorization Request/0100, Authorization Advice/0120, Reversal Request/0400, Acquirer
Reversal Advice/0420, and First Presentment/1240 message with the same value received in
DE 105, subelement 001 of the original Authorization Request Response/0110 message or
other original message response.
```
#### 5.4.2 Stand-In Processing Service.................................................................................................

```
This Rule does not apply to an Issuer in the Europe Region if on or before 17 September 2008,
the Issuer commenced its use of an alternative on-behalf authorization service that meets
Mastercard Switching Services’ performance standards as set forth in section 5.4.1.2
Performance Standards—Issuers of these Rules.
```
```
An Issuer is liable for all Transactions authorized (with or without PIN validation) using the
Stand-In Processing Service, provided that the Network correctly uses the Stand-In Parameters
```
```
Mastercard Scheme-Specific Requirements
5.3 Authorization Routing—Maestro POS, ATM Terminal, and PIN-based
```

```
defined by Mastercard Switching Services or the Issuer. The Issuer may establish Stand-In
Processing Service PIN validation at its option.
```
```
For all of its Mastercard Card Programs, an Issuer must use the Stand-In Processing Service.
Stand-In Investigation Service is now obsolete and replaced with Stand-In User Interface
located in the Fraud Center. Stand-In Parameters for Mastercard (including Debit Mastercard)
Card Programs must be set at or above Mastercard Switching Services’ default limits.
```
```
In the event that fraudulent activity is detected with respect to a Mastercard BIN or BIN range,
Mastercard Switching Services, in its sole discretion and judgment, may take such action as it
deems necessary or appropriate to safeguard its goodwill and reputation.
Such action may include, by way of example and not limitation, declining some or all Transaction
authorization requests received by the Stand-in Processing Service relating to the use of Cards
issued under such BIN or BIN range.
```
```
For all of its Maestro and Cirrus Card Programs, an Issuer must use the Stand-In Processing
Service. This requirement does not apply if the Issuer commenced its use of an alternative on-
behalf authorization service before 1 December 2003 and such service meets Mastercard
Switching Services’ performance standards as set forth in section 5.4.2.2 Performance
Standards—Issuers of these Rules.
```
```
Stand-In Parameters for Maestro and Cirrus Card Programs must be set at or above
Mastercard Switching Services’ default limits. An Issuer may employ a blocking service that
declines all Transaction authorization requests during Stand- In processing for inactive BINs or in
situations where Stand-In processing does not apply for regulatory reasons.
```
##### 5.4.2.1 Accumulative Transaction Limits................................................................................

```
An Issuer at its option, may use daily Stand-In Processing Service Transaction limits
(“accumulative limits”) for a Card Program that are higher than the applicable default limits set
by Mastercard Switching Services.
Refer to the Stand-In Processing Forms 041a (Brand Product Categories Addendum), 041f
(Accumulative Global Parameters), and 041g (Transaction Category Code Global Parameters)
for the minimum (default) daily accumulative Transaction processing limit applicable to a
particular Card Program.
```
##### 5.4.2.2 Performance Standards—Issuers...............................................................................

```
For all Transactions, an Issuer authorization failure rate that exceeds one percent for two
months in any six-month period is deemed to be substandard performance.
The Issuer failure rate is not applied until after the Issuer’s fourth calendar month of operation
or upon the Issuer’s processing of 5,000 Transactions in a calendar month, whichever occurs
first. The Issuer failure rate is calculated by taking the sum of ISO 8583 response codes 31—
issuer signed off, 82—time out at Issuer host, and 96—system malfunction, and dividing by the
total number of Transactions processed through the Issuer connection to the Network.
```

Chapter 4 of the Authorization Manual.
```
```
An Issuer must comply with the authorization response requirements set forth in “Routing Timer
Values” in Chapter 5 of the Authorization Manual. If the Issuer’s response is not received within
the required time frame, then the Transaction will time out and be forwarded via the Stand-In
Processing System or another alternate authorization provider as specified by the Issuer.
```
### 5.4.4 Preauthorizations...................................................................................................................

```
An authorization request is properly identified as a preauthorization when DE 61 (Point-of-
Service [POS] Data), subfield 7 (POS Transaction Status) contains a value of 4.
```
### 5.4.5 Final Authorizations...............................................................................................................

```
An authorization request is properly identified as a final authorization when DE 61 (Point-of-
Service [POS] Data), subfield 7 (POS Transaction Status) contains a value of 0 and DE 48
(Additional Data), subelement 61 (POS Data Extended Condition Codes), subfield 5 contains a
value of 1.
```
### 5.4.6 Multiple Authorizations.........................................................................................................

```
The Acquirer must use a unique identifier from the initial approved authorization of a
Transaction in any additional authorizations requested in connection with the same Transaction,
by populating:
```
- DE 48, subelement 63 (Trace ID) of each additional authorization request with the DE 63
    (Network Data), subfield 1 (Financial Network Code) and subfield 2 (Banknet Reference
    Number) and DE 15 (Date, Settlement) data from the initial approved Authorization
    Request Response/0110 message; and
- Effective 17 October 2025, DE 105 (Multi-Use Transaction Identification Data), subelement
    001 (Transaction Link Identifier [TLID]) of each additional authorization request with the
    same value populated in this field in the initial approved Authorization Request Response/
    0110 message.

```
These unique identifier must also be included in the Transaction clearing record.
```
### 5.4.7 Full and Partial Reversals......................................................................................................

```
An Acquirer must support reversals for the full amount of any authorized POS Transaction
whenever the Acquirer host system is unable to communicate the authorization response to the
POS Terminal.

### 5.4.8 Balance Inquiries.....................................................................................................................

```
Balance inquiries are identified with a value of 30 in DE 3, subfield 1 of authorization messages.
```
### 5.4.9 CVC 2 Verification for POS Transactions...........................................................................

```
An Issuer must not authorize a Mastercard POS Transaction identified as a mail order, phone
order, or e-commerce Transaction if the CVC 2 transmitted by the Acquirer does not match the
CVC 2 on file with the Issuer corresponding to the Mastercard Account in question (that is, DE
48, subelement 87 of the Authorization Request Responses/0110 message = “N”).
```
### 5.4.10 Decline Reason Code Service ............................................................................................

```
For all Card-not-present Transactions, excluding mail order and telephone order (MO/TO)
Transactions, the Decline Reason Code Service is an authorization functionality that translates
specific Issuer-provided decline-related response code values to one of three Mastercard-
provided values representing decline reason categories: Lifecycle, Policy, or Security.
```
```
A Merchant Advice Code (MAC) is also supplied for Card-not-present Transactions as applicable.
In cases of recurring payment or Credential-on-file Transactions, for certain decline response
code values such as Expired Card, the service calls the Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) service
to determine if a new expiry date is available. When a new expiry date is available, DE 48,
subelement 84 (Merchant Advice Code) is appended into the response message with a value
indicating to try again using the updated information; otherwise, an indicator to not try again is
included. In the case of a security violation decline response code for Card-not-present
Transactions, the Decision Intelligence service is called and based on the risk assessment, an
appropriate fraud/security-related MAC value is determined and sent to the acquirer.
```
```
The Decline Reason Code Service intakes the decline reason from the Issuer, categorizes when
appropriate, interprets the situation based on authorization data elements and additional
Mastercard services, and prescribes to the Acquirer and Merchant the best course of action to
take related to the decline through the decline reason and Merchant Advice codes. Technical and
credit-related declines are not categorized as part of this service.
```
```
Issuer use of the DE 39 (Response Code) value of 05 (Do Not Honor) should not exceed 5% of all
Mastercard and Maestro Card-not-present Transaction decline responses.

### 5.4.11 Account Status Inquiry (ASI) Requests ...........................................................................

```
An ASI request is an Authorization Request/0100 message initiated by an Acquirer or Merchant
to obtain the Issuer's validation that a Cardholder's Account is open and active.
An ASI request is identified with a value of 8 (Account Status Inquiry Service [ASI]) in DE 61
(Point-of-Service [POS] Data), subfield 7 (POS Transaction Status), and when submitted in
connection with a purchase, contains a value of 00 (Purchase) in DE 3 (Processing Code),
subfield 1 (Cardholder Transaction Type Code). A Purchase ASI request must have a Transaction
amount of zero.
```
```
Mastercard Scheme-Specific Requirements
Authorization Request Response/0110 Response Codes
```
© 2016–2024 Mastercard. Proprietary. All rights reserved.


```
Unless specifically permitted in the Standards, a purchase Transaction authorization request
must not contain a Transaction amount value of one major unit of currency or any other nominal
test amount that does not represent an actual purchase.
```
```
An Issuer that receives an ASI request must provide a valid and accurate value in DE 39
(Response Code) of the Authorization Request Response/0110 or Financial Transaction Request
Response/0210 message. If a Mastercard or Debit Mastercard Account is open and active, the
Issuer must provide a value of 00 (Approved) or 85 (Not Declined) in DE 39.
Mastercard will deem an Issuer to be noncompliant with this requirement if the Issuer declines
an ASI request involving a Mastercard or Debit Mastercard Account and within 24 hours of such
decline, approves a Transaction authorization request for a non-zero Transaction amount
involving the same Merchant or Sponsored Merchant and the same Account. A noncompliant
Issuer may be subject to fees under the global ASI Transaction Processing Excellence program.
```
### 5.4.12 Clearing Messages...............................................................................................................

```
In each First Presentment/1240 message sent for a portion of the total Transaction amount,
the Acquirer must populate DE 25 (Message Reason Code) with either of the following values:
```
- **1403** (Previously approved authorization - partial amount, multi-clearing); or
- **1404** (Previously approved authorization - partial amount, final clearing). This value indicates
    that the original authorization is closed; no subsequent clearing messages may be submitted.

```
Effective 17 October 2025, the Acquirer must populate DE 105 (Multi-Use Transaction
Identification Data), subelement 001 (Transaction Link Identifier [TLID]) of each First
Presentment/1240 message with the same TLID value received in the original Authorization
Request Response/0110 message or other original message response.
```
### 5.4.13 Multiple Clearing Messages...............................................................................................

```
A Mastercard Dual Message System Acquirer has the option of linking multiple presentments
with partial amounts to one approved authorization identified as either a preauthorization or
final authorization. The following requirements apply to Mastercard and Debit Mastercard
Transactions acquired in the Mastercard Dual Message System:
```
1. In the First Presentment/1240 message, the Acquirer may must populate DE 25 (Message
    Reason Code) with either of the following values:
    a. **1403** (Previously approved authorization - partial amount, multi-clearing); or
    b. **1404** (Previously approved authorization - partial amount, final clearing). This value
       indicates that the original authorization is closed; no subsequent clearing messages may
       be submitted.

```
If the final first presentment message submitted for a preauthorized Transaction contains a
value of 1403 in DE 25, and the total authorized amount has not been fully cleared, then the
Acquirer or Merchant must initiate an authorization reversal so that the Issuer may release
any excess hold on funds in the Cardholder's Account.
```

Code), subfield 2 (Advice Reason Detail Code) of a Mastercard Single Message System-generated
Financial Transaction Advice/0220 message.
```
3. Upon matching a clearing message to an authorization message, the Issuer must adjust any
    hold on the availability of funds in the Cardholder's Account in accordance with its standard
    Account management practice for cleared amounts:
    a. If the clearing message contains a value of **1403** , then the Issuer is advised to release
       the hold placed on the Cardholder's Account in connection with the approved
       authorization by the amount in DE 6 (Amount, Cardholder Billing); and
    b. If the clearing message contains a value of **1404** , then the Issuer is advised to release
       any unused funds in connection with the approved authorization.

Authorization Before Charging
```
```
Each electric vehicle charging Transaction for which authorization is requested before vehicle
charging begins is properly processed as follows:
```
1. The Merchant must inform the Cardholder of any estimated amount for which
    authorization will be requested (for example, on a screen display or sticker at the Terminal)
    and must obtain the Cardholder’s consent to the amount before initiating the authorization
    request. The estimated amount may be the Terminal’s maximum dispense amount or a
    specific amount requested by the Cardholder.
2. The Acquirer’s initial Authorization request/0100 message to the Issuer must be identified
    as a preauthorization. If the preauthorization request contains the partial approval support
    indicator, and the Issuer provides a partial approval response, then the final Transaction
    amount must not exceed the partial approval amount provided in DE 6 (Amount,
    Cardholder Billing).
3. If the Transaction is finalized for an amount that:
    a. Exceeds the authorized amount, then the Acquirer must send an additional
       (incremental) authorization request for the unauthorized amount; or
    b. Is less than the authorized amount, then within 24 hours of finalization, the Acquirer
       must either send a partial reversal for the excess authorized amount, or submit the
       Transaction clearing record.
4. In the case of a Transaction cancelled by the Cardholder, then within 24 hours, the Acquirer
    must send a full reversal request.

```
Authorization After Charging
If the Merchant initiates authorization after the vehicle charging is completed, then the
Acquirer’s authorization request must be identified as a final authorization as described in
section 5.4.5.
